### plot.clade.date ###
In plot.clade.date, handle the presence or absence of replicate values. If repvalues are not present in the clade.date object, plot the probability curve anyway (if a fit present), and return a message saying that if the empirical distribution is wanted, repvalues has to be switched to TRUE in clade.date
Similarly with fit.distr.


### Bugs ###

# When using the plotting option in clade.date:
"Error in hist.default(rA, breaks = breaks, freq = FALSE, xlim = XX, col = rgb(0.25,  : 
  'x' must be numeric"
# When fitting a skewstudent distribution in sn: "Error in integrate(fun.d, -Inf, alpha * zt[i], nu1 = nu + 1) : 
  the integral is probably divergent" Maybe switch to maxumum penalized likelihood estimation in seml, although that seems to work better for small sample size. Or play with sample size (pseudoreplicates): fewer samples seem to work.
# Fix bug preventing the plot of "skewnormal" and "skewstudent" funcitons.
 

### Add ancillary functions: ###

Extract clade ages for specific nodes from a collection of time-trees (e.g. a posterior distribution of trees from a Bayesian analysis), and fit distributions for developing secondary calibrations.

Plot empirical densities or probability densities on timetrees. Potentially accept ML trees and do a quick time scaling with chronos.

Check compatibility of calibrations. Look for function plot.prior in my files.

# Potentially add fossil graft or taxon graft to add fossil or outgroups to a tree?

# Add CalibMC ?


### DONE ###

Switched to the 'sn' package for fitting skew-normal and skew-Student distributions, returning parameters that can be used in MCMCtree.

Fixed the "quartz" bug. Deleted the call to quartz so the ploting function works in PC as well.

# In clade.date documentation file: #

Add skew normal to list of arguments

Change the apostrophe symbol in the citation of Claramunt & Cracraft

Change "Fages" to "Fossil.ages"

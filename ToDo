Consider switching to the 'sn' package for fitting skew-normal and skew-Student distributions.

### plot.clade.date ###
In plot.clade.date, handle the presence or absence of replicate values. If repvalues are not present in the clade.date object, plot the probability curve anyway (if a fit present), and return a message saying that if the empirical distribution is wanted, repvalues has to be switched to TRUE in clade.date
Similarly with fit.distr.


### Add ancillary functions like: ###

Plot empirical densities or probability densities on timetrees. Potentially accept ML trees and do a quick time scaling with chronos.

Check compatibility of calibrations

# Potentially add fossil graft or taxon graft to add fossil or outgroups to a tree?

# Add CalibMC ?


### DONE ###

### clade.date documentation file: ###

Add skew normal to list of arguments

Change the apostrophe symbol in the citation of Claramunt & Cracraft

Change "Fages" to "Fossil.ages"
